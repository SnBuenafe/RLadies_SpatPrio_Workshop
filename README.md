# RLadies_SpatPrio_Workshop

Hi all!

Welcome to the Sandra and Tin's GitHub repository on Spatial Workflows. In this repository you'll find the following:

1. Code that will be ran during the workshop. The R scripts are sequential (`01-03`). There's also an extra one named `utils-functions.R` which will be used in the R script prefixed by `03`.
2. The `Input/` folder that contains all of the necessary files required to run the R scripts. We trust that you please don't distribute any of these data, and if you will use it outside of the workshop, please contact us first.
3. The `Output/` folder is where all of the resulting outputs from each of the scripts will be saved in.
4. The `Figures/` folder is where all of the resulting figures from each of the scripts will be saved in.
5. We have also prepared an R Markdown (knitted as an `.html`) that has more detailed notes of all the code (+ more!).

If you have any questions, please don't hesitated to contact either Tin (k.buenafe@uq.edu.au) or Sandra (s.neubert@uq.edu.au).
